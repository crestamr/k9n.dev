    "intro": "My name is Danny Koppenhagen and  I am a passionate software developer and IT consultant. My profession is the development of web applications – especially of single page applications (SPA). My technology stack includes mainly Angular, RxJS, NgRx but also Vue.js and NativeScript. Furthermore I develop Node.js backends based on JavaScript and TypeScript. I am a IT consultant for web-architectures and -frameworks. During the development I am very focussed on the user experience (UX).",
